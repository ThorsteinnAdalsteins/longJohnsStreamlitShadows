## Saving text into a separate file

This text is written in markdown convention. The file is saved in the *markdowns/text_1.md* file and then imported into the home.py file using `st.markdown()` function. 

The text is then imported into the page. This allows me to:

1) Use numbered lists
2) Use code explanations
3) Keep things separate
4) Keep things uncluttered
