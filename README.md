How do you learn? You make enough mistakes that you stop noticing them

# What is the point here?

I recently rambled across a cool-tool in Python. 
This tool [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) allows you to write a python script and translate it directly into an app-website without the whole rigamorol involved in putting up a Django, wrap your code into Jinja template ectc. 

Furthermore, the tool hosts your apps, as long as you accept to make things look like a streamlit-mashed-mashed-potatoes app, but that may mean a bit of hacking around templates and css files.

## Now begins the process

1) Thousands of hours trying to write simple things
2) Thousands of hours making stupid mistakes and wrapping things into a convoluted spaghetty of codes, files, functions, tears, hatefull rambling etc
3) A few hours of figuring out how to actually do things
4) Thousands of hours undoing the mistakes in step 1 and 2 and re-factoring the code

After approximately 10000 hours of coding I'll be an EXPERT!!!
